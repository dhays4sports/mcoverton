- [ ] PC-1.6 — Production Release Certification

## PC-1.1 End-to-End Consultation Workflow Audit — Complete (3.20.47)

- Audited the real saved-record path from normalized intake through assessment, Workspace guidance, recommendation and completion persistence, homeowner document generation, and later reopening.
- Fixed customer-report availability by resolving the full active consultation record after queue selection instead of relying on its lightweight display summary.
- Carried the opaque consultation ID into the existing conversation plan and checklist persistence key so similar homeowners cannot inherit one another's working progress.
- Retained a deterministic legacy fallback for report-only journeys that do not yet have a consultation record ID.
- Kept workflow progress separate from evidence verification, producer recommendations, homeowner decisions, quote status, and carrier authority.
- Certified the current 408FARMERS FLOW-1.4 sender against the later CoverageFit contract without changing the sender runtime or handoff payload.

## PC-1.2 Producer Usability Polish — Complete (3.20.48)

- Added a compact Current Focus guide directly under the selected homeowner so the producer can see the active consultation stage before entering the detailed Command Center.
- Reused the existing six-stage Consultation Progress model for current stage, completion percentage, attention state, guidance, and destination links.
- Kept one explicit next action visible while scrolling on larger screens and converted it to a calm, full-width static guide on smaller screens.
- Adjusted guided target offsets so Command Center, verification, questions, recommendation, disposition, and follow-up surfaces remain visible below the sticky controls.
- Added accessible live updates and progress semantics without changing checklist, recommendation, completion, or consultation-record persistence.

- Checks the complete report shell, Letter page profile, running header and footer, page counters, print colors, readable split controls, final-page rule, and browser print capability before enabling printing.
- Gives the producer one calm output status and explicit Letter portrait, scale, background-graphics, browser-chrome, and final-review guidance.
- Hardens long-content pagination without changing assessment output, document story, recommendation order, producer decisions, or completion state.
- Keeps PC-1.5 Live Producer Pilot Readiness and deployed Safari/macOS device validation explicitly deferred.

## PC-1.5 Live Producer Pilot Readiness — Complete (3.20.51)

- Adds one preflight over the selected consultation, existing guided plan/checklist, secure PC-1.3 recovery path, existing Consultation Document action, and current-device Print Preview acknowledgement.
- Requires a server-backed consultation and connected secure producer inbox for the live pilot path; browser-local records remain available for ordinary offline work but do not satisfy the pilot gate.
- Gives the producer one next setup action and marks the path ready only when all five operational checks pass.
- Keeps the device acknowledgement limited to the selected consultation and current open Workspace session; it is not stored as a consultation result or production certification.
- Preserves the Command Center, Current Focus, Consultation Progress, Recommendation Builder, Consultation Completion, homeowner document, assessment, Protection Score, attribution, FLOW, and RC-SMS systems.
- Leaves execution evidence from the actual Dylan-led deployed Safari/macOS and physical-printer pilot, defect disposition, and final production release decision to PC-1.6.

## GC-1.1 Consultation Command Center — Complete (3.20.30)

- The first selected-consultation view answers Who, Why, Status, Top Priorities, Verify, and Next Action.
- The command center derives from the existing workspace snapshot, evidence handoff, consultation stage, and checklist progress.
- Recommendation order and evidence classifications remain unchanged.
- No parallel intake, assessment, consultation, attribution, reporting, or SMS architecture was introduced.

## GC-1.2 Prospect Story — Complete (3.20.31)

- Preserved intake and attribution are summarized as one readable prospect narrative inside the Command Center.
- Review reason remains distinct from occupation, housing, campaign, referral, entry, and urgency context.
- Homebuyer, professional, bundle, homeowner, partner-referred, SMS, direct, and time-sensitive journeys receive safe bounded language.
- Internal attribution identifiers remain hidden, and no eligibility, discount, rate, underwriting, timing, or coverage result is asserted.

## GC-1.3 Priority Findings — Complete (3.20.32)

- The Command Center ranks up to three findings by the existing assessment priority signals instead of trusting display order alone.
- Each finding names its sequence, explains why it leads the consultation, and provides a bounded evidence-based discussion cue.
- Assessment priority score remains authoritative; evidence state only resolves otherwise comparable findings and never changes Protection Score math.
- Older reports fall back to their existing priority labels and source order.
- The full recommendation list, evidence classifications, and producer judgment remain intact.

## GC-1.4 Verify Before Advising — Complete (3.20.33)

- The Command Center separates clear homeowner reports, CoverageFit interpretations, unanswered assessment details, and explicit confirmation work.
- Known information remains labeled as homeowner-reported; it is not promoted to a verified policy fact.
- Inferred findings remain visibly system-derived and cannot silently become confirmed facts.
- Missing information and needs-confirmation work retain their existing evidence classifications and source prompts.
- The existing detailed evidence handoff remains the full working view below the Command Center.

## GC-1.5 Guided Questions — Complete (3.20.34)

- The existing conversation planner derives a bounded list of next-best questions from assessment evidence and ranked findings.
- Missing and partial homeowner details remain distinct from policy-verification work and property confirmation.
- Existing follow-up prompts and recommendation conversation starters supply the wording; no generic static script library was added.
- Duplicate questions for the same assessment key are suppressed, while the original agenda and checklist remain unchanged.
- Questions guide the producer without converting findings, inferred information, or homeowner reports into verified facts.

## GC-1.6 Recommendation Builder — Complete (3.20.35)

- The existing ranked findings now feed one structured producer-judgment workflow inside the During phase.
- Each finding keeps CoverageFit’s rationale and evidence state visible while producer verification and producer reasoning remain explicit separate inputs.
- A finding cannot be marked for carrier quoting until the producer attests that relevant facts and policy language were verified.
- Structured judgments persist in the existing consultation record locally or through the secure producer inbox.
- Recommendation output remains consultation support and does not become a carrier proposal, underwriting decision, or automated coverage conclusion.

## GC-1.7 Explanation Assist — Complete (3.20.36)

- Each existing ranked Recommendation Builder finding now includes progressively disclosed beginner-friendly coaching.
- The coaching separates the specific assessment issue, plain-language meaning, homeowner relevance, natural talk track, and carrier-verification work.
- Topic guidance is centrally derived from existing assessment identifiers and finding context rather than duplicated across pages or campaigns.
- Verification status and producer judgment adjust the coaching cue without changing, choosing, or persisting a recommendation.
- Final limits, forms, eligibility, underwriting, and coverage outcomes remain subject to carrier confirmation and the issued policy.

## GC-1.8 Consultation Progress — Complete (3.20.37)

- The existing Agent Workspace now presents one six-stage consultation sequence: Understand, Verify, Discuss, Recommend, Decide, and Next step.
- Progress is derived from the current checklist, producer verification attestations, recommendation judgments, disposition, and follow-up state rather than stored in a parallel tracker.
- One current step is emphasized, completed stages remain visible, and skipped earlier work is labeled Needs attention instead of being silently treated as complete.
- Every stage links to its existing working surface, while the detailed checklist remains the place where questions and checks are completed.
- Deferred findings stay visibly unresolved, and no assessment information becomes verified merely because the consultation advanced.

## GC-1.9 Consultation Completion — Complete (3.20.38)

- The existing After phase now includes one structured consultation closeout for decisions, unresolved work, carrier-quote status and requirements, and the assigned next action.
- Existing Recommendation Builder judgments, assessment evidence, and secure follow-up status remain visible as context rather than being duplicated into a new workflow.
- Ambiguous completion is prevented: open unresolved work requires an explanation, a quote waiting on items requires those items, and every closeout requires a decision summary and next action.
- Saving advances an early record to Consultation completed while preserving later stages and never closing the record automatically.
- Local and secure server-backed records use the same additive completion contract and preserve attribution, reporting, FLOW, and RC-SMS behavior.

- Every part includes the same compact document map with the active part clearly identified.
- Semantic chapter markers establish bounded targets for CD-1.2 through CD-1.6 without adding a parallel document or report engine.
- Existing assessment, Protection Score, recommendation ordering, consultation persistence, attribution, reporting, FLOW, and RC-SMS behavior remain unchanged.

## CD-1.2 Executive Summary — Complete (3.20.40)

- The existing Review Overview now identifies the homeowner, home, contact information, and producer before explaining why the review started.
- One executive narrative summarizes what the existing assessment is showing without turning a response-based finding into a verified coverage fact.
- Strong foundation and first-focus callouts make the most useful starting context visible without changing Protection Score logic or recommendation ordering.
- Existing discussion priorities, missing information, and the derived next action remain visible in one scan-friendly sequence.
- Protection Snapshot refinement remains bounded to CD-1.3; downstream finding, recommendation, decision, language, and consistency work remains deferred to CD-1.4 through CD-1.8.

## CD-1.3 Protection Snapshot — Complete (3.20.41)

- One immutable presentation model maps the existing authoritative Protection Score into its canonical category, score range, interpretation, and scale position.
- The existing Review Overview score card now explains what the score means and how to use it during the consultation.
- A compact 0–100 band scale identifies the homeowner's position without changing the underlying score, bands, weights, or formula.
- Missing or invalid scores render a truthful Not scored state instead of being treated as zero.
- The card explicitly preserves the distinction between review readiness and any coverage, underwriting, pricing, eligibility, or policy decision.
- Priority Findings remain bounded to CD-1.4; later recommendation, decision, language, and consistency work remains deferred to CD-1.5 through CD-1.8.

## CD-1.4 Priority Findings — Complete (3.20.42)

- The existing Consultation Record now presents the three most meaningful findings in deterministic priority order using the established print recommendation model.
- Every finding clearly separates what the assessment found, why it appears in that position, and the evidence-aware action needed before advice is finalized.
- `Address first`, `Discuss next`, and `Also review` make the intended conversation sequence immediately scannable for a newer producer and understandable in the homeowner copy.
- Existing questions, exploration guidance, verification prompts, and note space remain in the Recommendations chapter instead of being rewritten early.
- Protection Score, assessment output, evidence classification, consultation persistence, attribution, FLOW, and RC-SMS behavior remain unchanged.
- Recommendation Explanations remain bounded to CD-1.5; later decision, language, and consistency work remains deferred to CD-1.6 through CD-1.8.

## CD-1.5 Recommendation Explanations — Complete (3.20.43)

- The Consultation Document now reuses the existing Recommendation Builder judgment and Explanation Assist education for each priority finding.
- Every topic separates recommendation status, verification readiness, what the topic means, why it matters, and the reason recorded by the producer.
- Undecided or unverified topics remain explicitly open and never appear as completed professional recommendations.
- `Recommend for carrier quote` remains a request for formal carrier evaluation, not a promise of coverage, pricing, eligibility, or underwriting approval.
- Existing assessment evidence and topic-specific policy checks remain visible in the conversation-support area.
- Decisions and Next Steps remain bounded to CD-1.6; later consumer-language and consistency work remains deferred to CD-1.7 and CD-1.8.

## CD-1.6 Decisions and Next Steps — Complete (3.20.44)

- The existing Consultation Document now consumes the structured closeout already saved by GC-1.9 instead of deriving a second decisions record.
- The chapter clearly presents what the homeowner decided, what remains open, formal carrier-quote status and requirements, finding-level producer judgments, and the agreed next action.
- Existing secure follow-up timing and notes appear beside the next action without duplicating scheduling or persistence.
- Completed closeouts and unfinished records have visibly different states; draft records never imply that a homeowner agreed, verification finished, or a quote was requested.
- Carrier forms, eligibility, underwriting, price, and issued-policy terms remain authoritative.
- The Consumer Language Pass remains bounded to CD-1.7; Producer/Consumer Consistency remains deferred to CD-1.8.

## CD-1.7 Consumer Language Pass — Complete (3.20.45)

- The existing three-part Consultation Document now uses one bounded consumer-language layer for CoverageFit-generated explanations.
- Score guidance, policy details, confirmation cues, recommendations, quote status, and final-policy guardrails use direct homeowner-readable language.
- Technical terms that must remain precise are explained inline, including the current policy summary (declarations page), estimated rebuilding amount, home deductible, and formal insurance quote.
- Homeowner decisions, producer-entered reasoning, record state, evidence classifications, recommendation judgments, and machine-readable document markers remain unchanged.
- The document continues to identify the formal quote and issued policy as the official sources and makes no coverage, price, eligibility, or insurance-company decision.
- Producer/Consumer Consistency remains bounded to CD-1.8.

## CD-1.8 Producer/Consumer Consistency — Complete (3.20.46)

- One immutable Producer/Consumer Story projection now connects the existing Command Center, Recommendation Builder, Consultation Completion record, and Consultation Document.
- The Workspace offers a progressive-disclosure preview of the story that will carry into the homeowner document without adding dashboard clutter.
- Review purpose, prospect narrative, priority IDs and order, confirmation details, recommendation state, completion state, and next action are sourced once and reused.
- The document no longer independently re-ranks its first three findings; it follows the same assessment-derived Command Center order Dylan sees.
- Unsaved or incomplete work remains clearly draft, and only saved producer judgments and completed closeout details appear as recorded decisions.
- The Consultation Document sprint family is complete. Any later document work should begin with an evidence-based audit of an actual defect or new product requirement.
